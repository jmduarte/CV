\begin{document}

Javier M. Duarte is an experimental high energy physicist, who studies the basic building blocks of matter at the highest energies producible in the laboratory.
The most energetic collider in the world is currently the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.
Duarte is a member of one of the large experimental collaborations consisting of several thousand scientists called CMS.
Such a large collaboration is needed to build the complex detector, operate it in the extreme conditions of the LHC beam, acquire the data from the collisions, and analyze the data to infer the properties and interactions of the subatomic particles produced in the collisions.
Nonetheless, Duarte is already recognized as an intellectual leader within the collaboration and the field.
The major research question that Duarte seeks to answer is what is the nature of the \emph{new physics} beyond the standard model of particle physics, the current best description of the elementary particles and the fundamental forces.

The direction Duarte pursues is to study the most recently discovered elementary particle, the Higgs boson, to see if its properties deviate from expectations, as this may provide crucial hints as to the nature of the new physics.
His research in CMS currently focuses on searches for and measurements of Higgs bosons decaying to quarks with large transverse momentum ($\pt$).
By studying the production of Higgs bosons at high $\pt$, Duarte's work is sensitive to new physics at very high energy scales.
In addition, Duarte searches for Higgs boson pair production in order to measure the Higgs boson self-interaction, a fundamental parameter of the standard model, necessary to confirm its validity.

Within CMS, he and his graduate student Raghav Kansal led a search for high-$\pt$ Higgs boson pair production in the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes and the final state with two bottom quarks and two vector bosons decaying to four quarks ($\PH\PH\to\bbbar 4q$)~[\mycite{CMS-PAS-HIG-23-012}].
It uses a new algorithm based on a transformer to identify the Higgs boson decay and is among the most sensitive to the interaction between two vector bosons and two Higgs bosons.
The search builds on a prior work by Duarte for high-\pt Higgs bosons decaying to \bbbar~[\mycite{Sirunyan:2020hwz}, \mycite{Sirunyan:2017dgc}, \mycite{CMS:2022nmn}, \mycite{CMS:2022dwd}].
It will be published as part of a forthcoming statistical combination of all CMS Higgs boson pair searches.
As Duarte's first graduate student, Raghav successfully defended his Ph.D. thesis partially based on this work in June 2024.

To enable these physics results, Duarte is a leader in the interdisciplinary subfield of ML for particle physics.
Rather than being explicitly programmed, ML algorithms learn directly from data and simulation to optimally perform a given task such as distinguishing Higgs bosons from background.
In the last review period, Duarte and collaborators applied novel ML algorithms to reconstruct particles from detector measurements in future electron-positron colliders~[\mycite{Pata:2023rhh}], track charged particles~[\mycite{Miao:2024oqy}], detect anomalies~[\mycite{Hao:2022zns}], compress data~[\mycite{Shenoy:2023ros}],  and accelerate simulation~[\mycite{Kansal:2022spb}, \mycite{Li:2023xhj}].
These results have been published in prominent particle physics journals like \emph{Phys. Rev. D}, \emph{Eur. Phys. J. C}, and \emph{Comm. Phys.} as well as the leading machine learning venues like the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) and \emph{Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol.}.

Duarte also leads efforts to develop and implement ML algorithms in dedicated hardware for very fast processing, with a \emph{latency} or delay of less than one microsecond, to improve the real-time LHC event selection, known as the trigger.
As the trigger selects the subset of collision events to be preserved for analysis, while discarding the rest, it is of paramount importance.
For this work, he designed, implemented, and benchmarked fast ML algorithms on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for science~[\mycite{Weng:2023tailor}, \mycite{Weng:2024fkeras}, \mycite{Campos:2023pkp}, \mycite{McDermott:2023neural}, \mycite{Odagiu:2024bkp}].
This work builds on a compiler framework that Duarte established previously~[\mycite{Duarte:2018ite}].
The impact of this work is tremendous: by enabling sophisticated ML algorithms to run in the trigger, events that may contain subtle signatures of new physics may be identified and preserved rather than lost forever.

Duarte has made contributions to several other CMS searches for new physics involving long-lived particles~[\mycite{CMS:2024bvl}, \mycite{CMS:2024ake}] and jets~[\mycite{CMS-PAS-EXO-24-007}].
Duarte serves as the co-convener of the Machine Learning group, where he oversees the publication of novel ML methods in CMS~[\mycite{CMS:2024twn}].
As a member of the CMS Collaboration, he is also an author of all CMS publications since 2011, many of which benefit from his indirect contributions.

Duarte's research group includes two postdoctoral fellows and three graduate students.
Duarte is a strong advocate for mentoring undergraduate researchers.
He and his group have mentored many undergraduate researchers who have published papers, presented their work at national conferences, and gone on to pursue graduate study or industry positions.

In the last review period, Duarte received the APS Henry Primakoff Award for Early-Career Particle Physics, Sloan Research Fellowship (\$75,000), and RCSA Cottrell Scholar Award (\$100,000).
He has also given invited talks at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) and the International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP).
His group is also funded by a Department of Energy (DOE) Early Career Award (ECA) for ``Real-Time Artificial Intelligence for Particle Reconstruction and Higgs Physics'' (\$750,000, 2020--2025) and the ``NSF Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Institute for Accelerated AI Algorithms for Data Driven Discovery (A3D3)'' (\$15,000,000 total, \$675,600 for UCSD, 2021--2026) focused on the domains of multimessenger astronomy, neuroscience, and particle physics.
Duarte is also part of two training grants: ``High Energy Physics Consortium for Advanced Training (HEPCAT)'' (\$3,700,000 total, \$110,000 for UCSD so far, 2021--2026) and ``Western Advanced Training for Computational High-Energy Physics (WATCHEP)'' (\$2,000,000 total, \$440,00 for UCSD, 2022--2027).
Finally, Duarte is also a Co-PI on a DOE Award for ``Real-time Data Reduction Codesign at the Extreme Edge for Science'' (\$750,000 total, \$225,000 for UCSD, 2021--2024).

Duarte is committed to the educational mission of our institution, with a focus on modern computational research in physics.
He has developed a new machine learning and data science course for graduate and undergraduate students in the Physics Department, that is extremely popular, and revamped two existing upper-division computational physics courses.
His unique approach of simultaneously teaching students necessary computational skills, while also giving them the opportunity to explore open-ended research questions in collaboration fellow students, will provide a valuable introduction to ``authentic research collaboration.''

Duarte is also a leader in equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in our department and beyond.
For his efforts on equitable graduate admissions, he was awarded a UCSD Inclusive Excellence Award.
He is also one of the Physics representatives to the Mentoring Project, which aims to improve mentoring practices in the Physical Sciences Division.
Beyond our department, he has helped established thriving programs for enhancing opportunities for underrepresented minority students in STEM: the HEPCAT (https://hepcat.ucsd.edu/), WATCHEP (https://watchep.org) and the NSF A3D3 Institute Postbaccalaurete Fellowship Program (https://a3d3.ai/).

In terms of service to the field, he has also peer-reviewed papers for \emph{Phys. Rev. Lett}, \emph{J. High Energy Phys.}, \emph{Phys. Lett. B}, \emph{Phys. Rev. D}, \emph{Phys. Rev. Research}, \emph{Eur. Phys. J. C}, \emph{Comput. Softw. Big Sci.}, \emph{Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A}, and \emph{Applied Optics}, and edited \emph{Front. Big Data} and \emph{Front. AI}.
He has also reviewed grant applications for the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, European Science Foundation, and the French National Research Agency.
